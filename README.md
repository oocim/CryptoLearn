## Project Overview

### Objective:  
**CryptoLearn** is a web application designed to provide an accessible and interactive platform for learning the fundamentals of cryptography. It aims to:  
1. Educate users about common encryption techniques and their strengths and weaknesses.  
2. Allow users to experiment with encrypting and decrypting messages using various cipher algorithms.  
3. Provide visual and textual explanations of the encryption process to enhance user understanding.  

### Key Features:  
- **Encryption Techniques:**  
  - *Caesar Cipher*: Shift-based substitution cipher for simple message encryption.  
  - *Simple Substitution Cipher*: Encrypts messages by substituting letters according to a defined key.  
  - *Vigenère Cipher*: A polyalphabetic cipher based on keyword-based shifts.  
  - *Rail Fence Cipher*: A transposition cipher using a zigzag pattern for message encryption.  
  - *Playfair Cipher*: A digraph substitution cipher for encoding pairs of letters.  
- **Interactive Learning:**  
  - Input plaintext messages and receive encrypted outputs in real-time.  
  - Visual breakdowns of how each cipher operates.  
- **Educational Content:**  
  - In-app explanations of cipher history, use cases, and limitations.  
  - Challenges to test understanding by solving encrypted puzzles.

## Project Scope

### Frontend:  
- Build a user-friendly interface using React to support:  
  - Input and output fields for encryption and decryption.  
  - Interactive forms for selecting cipher techniques and keys.  
  - Real-time display of results for user inputs.  
- Design a visually appealing and responsive layout for optimal usability across devices.  

### Backend:  
- Implement robust logic for the following encryption techniques:  
  - Caesar Cipher  
  - Simple Substitution Cipher  
  - Vigenère Cipher  
  - Rail Fence Cipher  
  - Playfair Cipher  
- Develop a **RESTful API** using **Node.js** and **Express** to:  
  - Handle encryption and decryption requests.  
  - Serve educational content and challenges.  
- Ensure secure data handling through input validation and sanitized interactions.  

### Project Manager/Fullstack:  
- Oversee integration between frontend and backend to ensure smooth communication and functionality.  
- Maintain and update a centralized GitHub repository with proper version control.  
- Ensure the application is scalable, secure, and adheres to the project timeline.

## Running the Website

### Frontend:
Run the following commands to start the frontend:

```bash
cd REACT-FULLSTACK/client
npm install
npm run start-frontend
```

Run the following commands to start the backend:
```bash
cd REACT-FULLSTACK/server
npm install
node index.js
```
Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, open the application in your browser to start exploring CryptoLearn.
